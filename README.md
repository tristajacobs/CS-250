# CS 250 - Sprint Review and Retrospective

## Artifact Description
This submission includes the Sprint Review and Retrospective from my final project. It showcases the Agile and Scrum practices I have applied throughout the course, including planning, collaboration, feedback gathering, and process improvement.

## Reflection

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**  
I interpret user needs by communicating clearly with stakeholders and translating their goals into specific tasks. Creating user stories helps because it breaks down needs into clear, actionable items that guide development and ensure I stay focused on user value.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**  
I approach program development with an iterative mindset, focusing on small, continuous improvements. I plan to keep using Agile processes like Scrum ceremonies (Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, Reviews, and Retrospectives) to stay organized, adaptive, and responsive to change.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**  
A good team member is someone who communicates openly, collaborates respectfully, supports others, and takes ownership of their work. Being dependable and fostering a positive team environment is essential for success in software development projects.
